## üöÄ Core Features

### 1. Semantic Search
```javascript
// Natural language search that understands intent
POST /api/genai/semantic-search
{
  "query": "cheap morning flights to Europe with good legroom",
  "topK": 10
}
```

### 2. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
```javascript
// Ask questions, get grounded answers
POST /api/genai/rag-query
{
  "question": "Which flight is best for a family with young children?",
  "flightIds": ["FL001", "FL002", "FL003"]
}
```

### 3. Price Prediction
```javascript
// Predict if prices will go up or down
POST /api/genai/predict-price
{
  "origin": "JFK",
  "destination": "LHR",
  "departureDate": "2025-06-15",
  "currentPrice": 650
}
```

### 4. Document Processing
```javascript
// Extract info from passport images
POST /api/genai/extract-document
{
  "imageData": "base64_encoded_image",
  "documentType": "passport"
}
```

### 5. Personalization
```javascript
// Get personalized recommendations
POST /api/genai/personalized-recommendations
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "flightIds": ["FL001", "FL002", "FL003"]
}
```

### 6. Proactive Assistance
```javascript
// Monitor flights for delays
POST /api/genai/monitor-flight
{
  "bookingId": "BK123",
  "userId": "user123",
  "flightId": "FL001"
}
```

## üéì Key Concepts

### Vector Embeddings
Convert text to 768-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts have similar vectors.

### Semantic Search
Search by meaning, not just keywords. "cheap flights" matches "budget-friendly options" and "affordable travel".

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
1. **Retrieve** relevant data from database
2. **Augment** AI prompt with that data
3. **Generate** response grounded in facts

### Multimodal AI
Process both text and images. Extract structured data from passports, boarding passes, etc.

### Personalization
Learn from user behavior over time. Adapt recommendations to individual preferences.

### Proactive Assistance
Don't wait for users to ask. Anticipate needs and provide help automatically.

## üî• Impressive Features

### 1. True Semantic Understanding
```
Query: "affordable morning departures to Europe"
Understands:
  - "affordable" = budget-conscious
  - "morning" = early departure time
  - "Europe" = multiple destinations
Returns: Semantically relevant flights, not just keyword matches
```

### 2. Grounded AI Responses
```
Question: "Which flight is best for business travel?"
Process:
  1. Retrieves actual flight data
  2. Analyzes features (duration, stops, timing)
  3. Generates answer citing specific flights
  4. Explains reasoning clearly
Result: Trustworthy answer based on real data
```

### 3. Predictive Intelligence
```
Analyzes:
  - Historical prices
  - Seasonality
  - Booking timeline
  - Demand patterns
Predicts:
  - Price will increase 15% in 7 days
  - 35% chance of delay
  - High demand period
Recommends: "Book now to save $95"
```

### 4. Seamless Document Processing
```
User uploads passport photo
System:
  1. Extracts all fields automatically
  2. Validates expiry date
  3. Checks 6-month rule
  4. Auto-fills booking form
  5. Warns if issues found
Result: 30-second process vs 5-minute manual entry
```

### 5. Adaptive Personalization
```
After 5 searches and 2 bookings:
  - Learns: Prefers morning flights
  - Learns: Budget-conscious
  - Learns: Likes Delta
  - Learns: Books 45 days out
Next search:
  - Ranks Delta morning flights higher
  - Suggests budget options first
  - Recommends booking in optimal window
```

### 6. Proactive Problem Solving
```
System detects: 60% delay probability
Actions:
  1. Alerts user 6 hours before flight
  2. Suggests earlier alternative
  3. Provides rebooking options
  4. Explains passenger rights
  5. Offers one-click rebooking
Result: User rebooked before delay announced
```
