- Real-time search with Elasticsearch vector similarity
- Displays results with relevance scores
- Example queries: "cheap flights to beach destinations", "business class to tech hubs"

#### üìä Price Prediction Tab
- ML-based price forecasting
- Shows predicted price, confidence level, and trend direction
- Provides actionable recommendations (book now vs wait)
- Analyzes historical data and seasonality patterns

#### üìö Document Q&A (RAG) Tab
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation for policy questions
- Ask questions about baggage, cancellations, travel policies
- Shows answer with source documents
- Example queries: "What is the baggage allowance?", "Can I change my flight?"

#### ‚ú® AI Recommendations Tab
- Personalized flight recommendations
- Shows user preferences and trending destinations
- Based on booking history and behavior patterns

#### üìã System Overview Tab
- Complete architecture documentation
- List of core technologies (Vertex AI, Elasticsearch, RAG)
- All available API endpoints
- Key features summary

### 2. Updated Main App (`frontend/src/index.js`)
- Added view mode switcher between "booking" and "showcase"
- Added "ü§ñ View Gen AI Showcase" button in booking interface header
- Added "‚Üê Back to Booking" button in showcase interface
- Seamless navigation between both interfaces

### 3. Updated Documentation (`frontend/README.md`)
- Added section explaining both interfaces
- Clear description of Gen AI Showcase features
